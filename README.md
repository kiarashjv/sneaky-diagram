# Energy Flow Sankey Diagram

This project visualizes energy consumption data using a Sankey diagram. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses Highcharts for data visualization.

## Project Overview

This React application fetches energy consumption data from a backend API and displays it in an interactive Sankey diagram. The diagram shows the flow of energy from various sources through different sectors, illustrating energy consumption and loss.
